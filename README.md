# Impact of Age, Reaction Time, Height, and BMI on Olympic Swimming
With its blend of power, endurance, and precision, the sport of swimming pushes athletes to their physical and mental limits, leaving spectators awestruck as records are shattered and new champions emerge. However, beneath the surface of this impressive spectacle lies an assembly of factors that greatly influence an athlete's performance in the pool. In this article, we delve into factors spanning biological traits–height and age–as well as trained abilities like reaction time and weight (measured as BMI) to examine how much they contribute to success in Olympic swimming. 

We aim to answer: what kind of relationship do these factors have with race time? Can we rank their overall order of importance, or do they depend on the length of the race? How do they differ among races of different lengths?
